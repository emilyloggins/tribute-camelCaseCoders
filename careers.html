        <h2>Intro to Pitbull</h2>

        <p>Armando Christian PÃ©rez (born January 15, 1981), known by the stage name Pitbull (also known as Mr.
            Worldwide),
            is an American rapper. His first recorded mainstream performance was on a solo track from Lil Jon's 2002
            album
            Kings of Crunk. In 2004, Pitbull released his debut album M.I.A.M.I. under TVT Records. It included
            production
            producers Lil Jon and Jim Jonsin. Pitbull later released his second album El Mariel, in 2006 and his third,
            The
            Boatlift, in 2007. His fourth album, Rebelution (2009), included his breakthrough hit single "I Know You
            Want
            Me (Calle Ocho)", which peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100.</p>

        <p>After rebranding himself as a pop artist, Pitbull's next album, Planet Pit, featured his first US number one
            single
            "Give Me Everything". His 2013 track "Timber", topped the charts in twenty nations, including the US and UK.
            He
            performed the song "We Are One (Ole Ola)" along with Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte, which served as the
            official
            theme of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.</p>

        <p>He said he chose his stage name of Pitbull because the dogs "bite to lock. The dog is too stupid to lose. And
            they're outlawed in Dade County. They're basically everything that I am. It's been a constant fight". After
            meeting Lil Jon in Miami, Pitbull was featured on Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz' album Kings of Crunk in
            2002. Pitbull's song "Oye" was featured on the soundtrack to the film 2 Fast 2 Furious the following
            year. In addition, Pitbull released several mixtapes, composed of freestyles and remixes of popular rap
            music. Pitbull also worked with Uncle Luke during his early career, being featured on Luke's 2001 album
            Somethin' Nasty, including the single "Lollipop" along with Lil' Zane.</p>
