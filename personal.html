            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Armando Christian Perez was born on January 15, 1981 to Cuban expatriates in Miami, Florida. When he was 3, he could recite the works of Cuba's national hero and poet, José Martí, in Spanish. Growing up, he was influenced by the Miami bass genre of pop music and has cited Celia Cruz and Willy Chirino as sources of inspiration for his music. Pérez's parents separated when he was young, and he was raised by his mother; he later spent time with a foster family in Roswell, Georgia. He attended South Miami Senior High School before graduating from Miami Coral Park High School, where he focused his career on rapping.</p>
            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>The rapper has no wife but has four children from different women. Two of his children are from Barbara Alba, his former girlfriend. Pitbull has not disclosed any information about his other children. He always stays mute whenever he is asked about his kids and hardly makes comments about his love life. Even though he and Barbara are no longer together the duo are still in joint tutelage of their children</p>
